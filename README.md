# Developing "get 3 offers" sales promotion application, by using Shopify API.

## How it works

1.  Customer request 3 price offers, like a price on the cheapest "iphone screen repairs".
2.  Shop owerns can now send an offer back to customer, maximum 3 offers.

## Who, where

This application will be used by different shop owners to send a offer to customers.

The customers will use the **Shopify store** to request a offer by creating a order.

## Tech

I'm using Heroku Cloud, because they make it easy to deploy and scale web applications, and everything can be customized through the command-line interface or application interface.

### Backend

Node, Hapi, MongoDB, Mongoose, Joi

### Frontend

React, Redux, Router5, MaterialUI
